The MCPD Emergency Response System (ERS) is an ASP.NET based web-application that allows users to store and view data related to various locations around Michigan City, Indiana. A backend SQL database is used to store records.  Information stored includes:
•	A building’s name
•	Address
•	Type of building i.e. school, medical, government, bank, and private
•	Emergency Contact Information
•	Interior floorplans
•	Exterior photographs 
Building records are searched by name, address, or keywords. Upon location selection, an image gallery containing all stored photos of the selected location is displayed. Once a specific image is selected, it is expanded on the screen and able to be manipulated by the user (zoom, scroll, drag, etc.). The application is best used as a sort of “central-command center” by officers and personnel currently on location. The ERS is accessible only by authorized LEO’s and relevant personnel. 
Included with this written documentation are a few short videos for each page, giving a basic rundown of how each page operates. 
There are four pages that make up the ERS:
•	Home/Login
•	Account Creation
•	Display (where building selection/viewing is done)
•	Maintenance (Admin page)
